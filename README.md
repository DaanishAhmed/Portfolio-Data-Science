Many of these projects highlight multiple skills needed by data scientists, such as problem identification, data exploration, data cleaning, data sampling, building predictive models, comparing models, data storytelling (communication), creating visualizations, and providing solutions to business problems.  Some of these are group projects, for which they showcase my ability to effectively collaborate with others.


R
----------------

### Association Rules on Burn Injury Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/R-Association-Rules

This project involves using R to examine a dataset containing information about burn victims. I analyzed the data to generate association rules, which offer insights about cases that frequently appear together. The goal is to understand some of the causes for certain burn cases and identify factors that influence burn severity.


### Logistic Regression on Heart Attack Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/R-Regression

This project involves using R to examine a dataset containing information about heart attack cases. In my analysis, I generated a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a patient dying from a heart attack. I compared this model with a Na√Øve Bayes classification model to see which model is more accurate. The goal is to maximize the accuracy of my final model recommendation to ensure effective classification of heart attack cases.

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/R-Neural-Network

This project involves using R to examine a dataset containing heart disease information. My analysis involves creating neural network models to predict a patient's vital status at the time of their last follow-up session (whether they are alive or dead). I will create three models and tune their parameters to produce the most accurate model possible.


### K-Means Clustering on Leaf Species Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/R-Clustering

This project involves using R to examine a dataset containing leaf species information. My goal is to categorize leaf specimens into their correct species based on their characteristics. I will do this by using k-means clustering, an unsupervised classification method that finds shared characteristics between cases and groups them into appropriate clusters.


### Text Mining Analysis on President Donald Trump's Tweets (Group Project)

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/R-Text-Mining-Group-Project

This is a group project where I collaborated with two other UMUC graduate students. The project is a text mining analysis where we analyzed the tweets sent by President (then candidate) Donald J. Trump during the 2016 presidential election. Our method involved finding terms that frequently appear together and determining the relationships between those words. We also used visualizations to determine the most prominent words and their significance. Our goal was to understand the important concepts and phrases of Trump's campaign and study what made his message resonate with voters.


SAS Enterprise Miner
----------------

### Linear Regression on Vehicle Fuel Economy Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/SAS-EM-Linear-Regression

This project involves using SAS Enterprise Miner to analyze a dataset containing vehicle fuel economy information. I will create several distinct linear regression models to predict the value of a vehicle's fuel economy. Each model will use different parameters and variable selection methods. I will then evaluate these models to determine which is the most accurate.


### Logistic Regression on Cellular Phone Company Churn Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/SAS-EM-Logistic-Regression

This project involves using SAS Enterprise Miner to analyze a dataset containing customer churn information from a cellular phone company. I will create several distinct logistic regression models to predict whether a given customer will churn. Each model will use different parameters and variable selection methods. I will then evaluate the models to find not only the most accurate model, but also the one that can identify the highest number of churners. My goal is to create a model that can accurately identify likely churners and minimize financial losses for the company.


### Support Vector Machines on Vehicle Accident Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/SAS-EM-SVM

This project involves building Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using SAS Enterprise Miner on a dataset containing vehicular accident information. SVM is a classification method that involves separating two or more classes of data. To achieve perfect or near-perfect classification, the data may need to be transformed using a kernel function. My analysis involves using several different kernel functions to see which is the most accurate. Additionally, I will determine which method is the most effective at identifying fatal accidents in particular.


### Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forests on Vehicle Purchase Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/SAS-EM-Ensemble-Models-1

This project involves using SAS Enterprise Miner to analyze a dataset containing vehicle purchase information. In this analysis, I will use ensemble models, which combine distinct models and average their outputs. I will create bagging, boosting, gradient boosting, and random forest models--all of which are ensemble variants of the decision tree. My goal is to determine which of these methods is the most accurate, and which is most effective at classifying bad vehicle purchases.


### Heterogeneous Models on Vehicle Accident Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/SAS-EM-Ensemble-Models-2

This project involves using SAS Enterprise Miner to analyze a dataset containing vehicular accident information. I will use ensemble models, which combine distinct models and average their outputs. Heterogeneous models combine different types of predictive models (such as regression, neural networks, and SVM). By experimenting with different combinations of ensemble and individual models, I will determine which method is the most accurate and which can identify the highest number of fatal accidents.


Python
----------------

### Text Mining Analysis on Film Reviews (Using Python and Tableau)

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/Python-Tableau-Text-Mining

This project involves using Python to analyze five film review texts written between 1934 and 2014. My goal is to perform a text analysis on these reviews to study how critics' word choices changed over time. I created a Python script that returns the 30 most common words in each document and how often those words appeared. The program filters out stop words (such as "and," "like," and "but"), removes punctuation, and handles stemming (i.e. words such as "write" and "writing" are listed as the same word). After running the program on all five reviews, I combined the results into a single spreadsheet and examined them using visualizations in Tableau. I used these visualizations to study whether these word choices reflect audiences' changing tastes in films over time.


SQL
----------------

### Querying and ERD Design on Airlines Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/SQL-ERD-Querying-Project

This is a simple SQL project that showcases querying on an airlines dataset. It showcases queries such as select statement variations, inserting and removing data, manipulating records in tables, join statements, ordering and grouping, variable creation, filtering, and querying by date. The project contains 10 problems, which are all included in the file "Airlines Querying Exercise.xlsx".


### Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) on Company Product Order Data (Group Project)

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/SQL-ETL-Group-Project

This is a group project where I collaborated with two other UMUC graduate students. The project involves using SQL code to create an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) sequence on three separate product order datasets from 2012, 2013, and 2014. The goal is to combine these three files into a single spreadsheet so it can be loaded into our organization's new data mart.


Tableau
----------------

### Time Series Analysis on Countries Through Time (Video)

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/Tableau-Time-Series-Presentation

This presentation was made using Tableau software, and it involves analyzing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), life expectancy, and child mortality rate of five countries between 1960 and 2015. The data was collected from the United Nations for the following countries: the United States, China, Sweden, the Philippines, and Afghanistan. The goal is to determine the existence and strength of any relationship between GDP and life expectancy or mortality rate. Additionally, I used time series analysis to predict each country's life expectancy, mortality rate, and GDP up to the year 2020 and studied whether those predictions were reliable.


Watson Analytics
----------------

### Exploratory Data Analysis on Employee Attrition Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/Watson-Analytics-Exploratory-Analysis

This project involves the use of Watson Analytics to analyze a dataset containing employee attrition information. My goal is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the trends and relationships between variables in the data. I do this by creating visualizations and dashboards that explore the connections between important variables. The results should offer some insights regarding the causes of employee attrition.


### Decision Tree Analysis on Categorical and Continuous Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/Watson-Analytics-Decision-Trees

This project involves the use of Watson Analytics to analyze two datasets: a customer churn dataset with a categorical target, and a sales profits and costs dataset with a continuous target. I used decision trees to classify the outcomes for both datasets. My goal in the churn dataset is to predict whether a customer will churn, whereas my goal in the sales dataset is to maximize the gross profit. I then evaluated whether the solutions provided by the decision trees were attainable by my organization.


### Display Development on Employee Attrition and Sales Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/Watson-Analytics-Display-Development

This project involves the use of Watson Analytics to analyze two datasets: an employee attrition dataset and a sales profits and costs dataset. My goal is to analyze these datasets using visualizations and see how the results can help my company. I will then communicate my findings using displays and storybooks. Additionally, I will incorporate social media data from Twitter that is relevant to my two datasets. I will explore and present this data in visual format to provide useful insights for my organization.


### Complete Data Analysis on Vehicle Accident Data

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/Watson-Analytics-Complete-Analysis

This project involves the use of Watson Analytics to analyze a dataset containing vehicle accident information. In my analysis, I explored the data using an exploratory data analysis (EDA), leveraged visualizations, built decision trees to classify accident severity, communicated my findings using dashboards and storybooks, and implemented social media data to enhance my findings.


DecisionsFirst
----------------

### Decision Requirements Analysis on Customer Loyalty Programs

https://github.com/DaanishAhmed/DecisionsFirst-Decision-Requirements

This project involves using DecisionsFirst software to frame the decision making process for a retail company regarding its customer loyalty program. My goal is to create a Decision Requirements Diagram (DRD) that focuses on determining which reward to offer a customer. In my analysis, I break down the factors that contribute towards making this decision--such as sub-decisions, requirements for each decision, and policies that dictate each decision. Finally, I propose solutions on how to maximize the effectiveness of my organization's customer loyalty program.
